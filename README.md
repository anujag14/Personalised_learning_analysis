This research investigates the use of machine learning in personalized learning analysis with PySpark. 
It uses classification methods involving Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Logistic 
Regression to estimate student involvement and dropout likelihood. K-Means clustering is used in 
conjunction with PCA to visualize data. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, category 
encoding, feature scaling, and balancing with SMOTE. 

For classification, the models are evaluated according to accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, and silhouette 
score for clustering. These findings are useful in identifying at-risk students and improving instructional practices.

Tableau is deployed to further visualize the insights and findings from the dataset.
The paper also includes information about installing various software, such as Java, Hadoop, 
Spark Shell and Tableau, necessary to carry out the project.

PySpark and Tableau were deployed on the Peronalised_learning_dataset.
